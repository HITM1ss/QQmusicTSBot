# TSBot Music - Frontend

A modern Vue.js frontend for the TSBot music player with comprehensive music management features.

System settings include frontend/backend build versions, stable-release checks, and one-click updates for configured Linux/systemd Compose hosts. See [host updater setup](../docs/UPDATING.md). Vite injects `VITE_TSBOT_VERSION` and `VITE_TSBOT_REVISION` during builds and emits `version.json`; local development is labeled as a development build.

## Features

## Technology Stack

- **Vue 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide Icons** - Beautiful, customizable icons
- **Vue Router** - Client-side routing
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- TSBot backend server running

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment** (optional):
   The recommended default is same-origin `/api`, which works with the repository's Vite and Docker proxy setup:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE=/api
   ```
   If your backend is on a completely different origin and you do not use the built-in proxy, set it to an absolute URL instead.

3. **Development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to the backend target derived from `TSBOT_HOST` / `TSBOT_PORT` (or `TSBOT_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET`). If you access the dev server through a remote domain, also set `TSBOT_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
   ```

5. **Repository production helper**:
   ```bash
   ../run-web.sh
   ```

## Key Components

### MusicPlayer
The main music player component featuring:
- Play/pause, skip controls
- Progress bar with seeking
- Volume control
- Current track display with artwork
- Like/unlike functionality

### LyricsDisplay
Real-time lyrics display with:
- Auto-scrolling synchronized lyrics
- Highlighted current line
- Smooth animations
- Error handling for missing lyrics

### PlaylistView
Enhanced playlist management with:
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Multi-select operations
- Search and filtering
- Batch operations

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the TSBot backend through REST APIs:

- `GET /queue` - Get current playback queue
- `POST /queue/qqmusic` - Add a QQ Music song to the queue
- `GET /qqmusic/search/songs` - Search QQ Music
- `GET /voice/status` - Get player status
- `POST /voice/play` - Control playback
- `GET /lyrics/{queueItemId}` - Get lyrics for the queued media

## Configuration

### Music Authorization
To authorize protected music sources:

1. Go to the Settings page (`/settings?group=authorization`)
2. Scan the QR code or enter a QQ Music cookie
3. The credential is encrypted and stored server-side for playback or source-specific requests

### Customization

The app uses TailwindCSS for styling. You can customize:

- Colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Component styles in `src/style.css`
- Layout and spacing throughout the components

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Code Style

- TypeScript for type safety
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Consistent component structure
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility considerations

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Chromium 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failed**
   - Ensure backend server is running
   - Recommended default is `VITE_API_BASE=/api`
   - If you bypass same-origin proxying, point `VITE_API_BASE` or `TSBOT_WEB_API_PROXY_TARGET` at the correct backend
   - If you access Vite through a domain, whitelist it via `TSBOT_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`

2. **Music Authorization Not Working**
   - Refresh the authorization status in Settings
   - Scan a new QR code or verify the cookie format and validity
   - Check the backend log for the upstream source response

3. **Styling Issues**
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure Tailwind is processed
   - Check browser console for CSS errors
   - Verify PostCSS configuration
